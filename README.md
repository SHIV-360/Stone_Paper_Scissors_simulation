# Stone Paper Scissors Simulation - Day 1

## Overview
This is a simulation of the classic game Stone, Paper, Scissors using Python's Turtle graphics module. On Day 1, the focus was on setting up the basic environment, initializing the objects, and implementing basic movement and collision detection.

## Day 1 Tasks:
- Set up the initial game window using Turtle graphics.
- Created a boundary box to represent the playing field.
- Initialized 3 types of objects (stone, paper, scissors) and assigned random movement.
- Implemented collision detection between objects.
- Set up a leaderboard that tracks the number of each type of object in the simulation.

## Next Steps:
- Implement object interactions where objects change type upon collision (e.g., Stone vs Paper, Paper vs Scissors).
- Start working on the game logic to declare a winner.
